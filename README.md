A modern dashboard application built with React and TypeScript, featuring a clean UI with a purple theme.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Static type-checking for JavaScript
- **React Router**: For navigation between different sections
- **Lucide Icons**: For consistent iconography throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with utility classes

## Project Structure

The application follows a component-based architecture:

- `src/components/layout`: Contains layout components like Sidebar
- `src/mock-data.ts`: Contains mock data for development and testing

## Features

- **Responsive Sidebar**: Collapsible sidebar with navigation links
- **Dashboard Overview**: Main dashboard with program cards and statistics
- **Group Calls**: Interface for managing and joining video calls
- **Notifications System**: Real-time notification display

## Color Scheme

The application uses a custom color palette:
- Primary: Techrity Purple (`bg-techrity-purple`)
- Accent: Techrity Rating color for highlights
- Text: White with various opacity levels for hierarchy
- Background: Dark theme with subtle gradients
