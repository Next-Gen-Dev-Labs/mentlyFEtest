# Frontend Developer Test

Welcome to the frontend developer test! This task is designed to evaluate your ability to accurately translate a visual design into a responsive, reusable, and functional React component using modern tools and best practices and code ethics.

---

## 🧩 Task

You are required to implement a screen based on the **design image provided in the `assets/` folder** of this project. This is a **Next.js App Router (Next.js 13+) project**, so follow the conventions of the App Router structure.

Your goal is to:
- Build a functional and reusable React component based on the screen image provided.
- Use **TailwindCSS** for styling.
- Ensure the component is **functional**, not just static — e.g., handle interactivity like form inputs, buttons, toggles, modals etc., if present.
- Follow proper **code organization**, **naming conventions**, and **accessibility** practices.
